     *  observe that f decreases fastest in the direction of the negative gradient. A step length
     *  parameter, that is allowed to change in every iteration, determines the magnitude of the 
     *  step taken.

     *  \param d First order partial derivatives of f at x.
     *           Input: variables given as vector of size Nx1.
     *           Output: all partial derivates of f at x given as column vector Nx1.
     *  \param x Variables of function f given as vector of size Nx1 vector. Will be updated in case of success.
     *  \return Status indicating success or failure due to ill-conditioned input.
